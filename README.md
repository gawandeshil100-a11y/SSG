## About This Portfolio

This repository presents three complete analytics case studies covering supply-chain operations, urban mobility, and e-commerce. Each project progresses from data ingestion and quality validation to analytical modeling, interactive Power BI reporting, scenario simulation, actionable recommendations, and controlled BRD/FRD documentation.

The digital twins extend traditional dashboards from **“What happened?”** to **“What could happen if operating policies change?”** Results are generated through transparent Monte Carlo simulations with documented assumptions and confidence ranges.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Supply Chain Intelligence & Digital Twin

> Simulates how inventory, supplier, logistics, quality, and demand policies affect service, stockouts, profit, and working inventory.

| Area | Details |
|---|---|
| Data | 100-SKU supply-chain dataset |
| Analytics | KPIs, EDA, profitability, product segmentation, supplier and logistics scores |
| Digital twin | Daily demand, inventory, replenishment pipeline, defects, fulfillment, revenue, and cost |
| Scenarios | Baseline, Lean, Recommended, Resilience |
| Tools | Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Jupyter, Power BI |

**Selected results**

- Recommended policy improved modeled service level from **67.8% to 78.7%**.
- Modeled lost demand decreased by approximately **14,178 units**.
- Modeled 90-day profit increased by approximately **183,170**, subject to prototype cost assumptions.

|---|---|
| Data | 896 monthly records, January 2010–May 2026 |
| Coverage | Six mobility license classes |
| Data engineering | Python ingestion, cleaning, validation, and processed datasets |
| Warehouse | Snowflake tables and analytical KPI views |
| Digital twin | Demand, vehicles, drivers, trip time, capacity, served/unmet trips, sharing, and emissions proxy |
| Tools | Python, pandas, NumPy, Snowflake SQL, Power BI |

**Selected results**

|---|---|
| Data | 500 orders and 1,500 order-detail records |
| Historical KPIs | ₹437,771 sales, ₹36,963 profit, 5,615 units |
| ETL | PostgreSQL staging, auditing, cleaning, constraints, indexes, and views |
| Digital twin | Demand, virtual inventory, replenishment, fulfillment, returns, pricing, cost, and profit |
| Scenarios | Baseline, Growth, Margin Guard, Inventory Optimized, Stress |
| Tools | PostgreSQL, Python, pandas, NumPy, Power BI |

**Selected results**

- Margin Guard increased modeled profit from approximately **₹12,951 to ₹26,849**.
- Inventory Optimized improved modeled fill rate from **92.6% to 95.5%**.
- Modeled lost units decreased by approximately **37%**.
- Blanket discount-led Growth increased revenue but produced an estimated **₹10,009 loss**.

## Skills Demonstrated

- End-to-end data analytics and data-engineering workflow design
- Data cleaning, quality validation, schema design, and referential integrity
- PostgreSQL and Snowflake analytical SQL
- KPI definition, profitability analysis, segmentation, and exception reporting
- Python Monte Carlo simulation and digital-twin state modeling
- Scenario design, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty ranges, and risk interpretation
- Power BI data modeling, dashboard design, slicers, trends, and drill-through
- Business requirements, functional requirements, acceptance tests, and governance
- Translation of analytical findings into operational recommendations

## Important Modeling Note

The digital-twin results in this portfolio are **scenario estimates**, not guaranteed forecasts. Where operational fields were unavailable, assumptions were explicitly defined and documented. Production implementation would require additional dated events, business constraints, financial reconciliation, back-testing, monitoring, and human approval workflows.
